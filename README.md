# Countries app

An app which displays various information about countries, built on the [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/) API.

## Why does this exist?

To demonstrate that I can write code to any prospective employers and to skill up in React/Next.js.

## Why did you choose Next.js?

To round out my skillset more (as I'm more experienced in Angular) and because it provides a nice structure to build React applications in (not to mention the cool static and server-side rendering capabilities to get great Lighthouse scores).

## Running locally

Install packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Run development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or you can do a production build and serve that locally:

```sh
npm run build && npm run start
```
